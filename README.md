===========

A save the date is a notice stating the date of a significant event such as a wedding. It is typically sent to 
those likely to be interested or affected by the event and states the planned date of the occasion so that recipients 
who wish to attend know to keep that date free. For weddings, save the dates usually take the form of a card. 
The purpose of the Save the Date app is to notify guests of the wedding date in a modern way. Instead, sending the 
save the date in the mail the Save the Date app communicates the notice on Facebook.
